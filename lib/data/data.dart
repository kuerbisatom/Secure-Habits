  "Step 0: Download KeePassXC at: \nhttps://keepassxc.org/\nand install it.\n\nStep 1: After the installation, you should start with the option 'Create a new Database'.\n\nStep 2: Follow the steps with the recommended settings. When prompted to enter a password, you should use the passphrase that you have generated in a previous task.\n(Hint: Do not forget the passphrase!)\n\nStep 3: Afterwards, with 'Add a new entry' (circled plus symbol) you can add your credentials for each account. Press 'Ok' when finished.\n\nStep4: Create a password for tomorrow's task, by pressing 'Add a new entry'. Afterwards, name it 'Secure Backup', and press on the password input field the square.

You can generate a new one with the password manager.\n(Therefore open the password manager, press right click on the entry 'Secure Backup' you created yesterday and press 'Copy Password' to copy the password and paste it into the VeraCrypt password field. You will need the password every time you want to access the external drive, therefore assure you copied the correct password.)\nAfterwards, press 'Next'.\n\nStep 6: Now, move the mouse, as described in VeraCrypt, as much and randomly as possible in the window. When the bar is full, press 'Format'. This starts the formatting and encryption process. The encryption process may take some time, depending on the size of your external drive.\n(When there is data on the external drive, you may need to accept it by pressing: 'Erase any files stored on the partition by creating a VeraCrypt volume within it'.)\nWhen it is finished, a Dialog Box appears, where you can press 'OK'. Afterwards, close the 'Volume Created' window by pressing 'Exit'. Now you have an encrypted formatted external drive.\n\nStep 7: Now you are going to save the folder/file on your encrypted drive. Therefore choose an arbitrary drive-name (e.g. M:) and press 'Auto-Mount Devices'. Now you need to enter your previously chosen password and press 'OK'. VeraCrypt will now mount the device.\n\nStep 8: Double click on the chosen drive name and your file explorer will open. Now you can copy the folder/file you want to back up to the encrypted drive (Just place a copy of the file on the encrypted drive!). Afterwards, close the file explorer and go back to VeraCrypt.
